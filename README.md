# CloudInfra-360 Case Study: Transformed 2 Succeed (T2S)

**Client:** Transformed 2 Succeed (T2S)  
**Project Status:** In Progress

## Summary
CloudInfra-360 is a multi-cloud Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) template developed for Transformed 2 Succeed (T2S) to scale its global mentorship and training programs. With growth across international regions, T2S required a secure, scalable, and compliant infrastructure spanning AWS, Azure, and GCP—while maintaining network consistency, observability, and hybrid cloud readiness.

## Situation
T2S faced increasing demand and technical requirements:
- Operate across multiple regions and cloud platforms
- Enforce zero trust security at all layers
- Achieve visibility and observability for cloud-native operations
- Reduce risk and overhead with reproducible, modular automation

## Task
Build a production-ready, reusable multi-cloud infrastructure template that:
- Provisions VPC/VNet, Subnets, Peering, VPN, NAT, and Gateways across clouds
- Implements IAM, NSGs, KMS, and cloud-native DDoS protection
- Enables full-stack observability across networking and security
- Is driven by modular Terraform and Terragrunt
- Supports environment-specific deployment (dev, staging, prod)
- Enables automation via Taskfile.yaml

## Action
The CloudInfra-360 solution was designed with a modular directory structure, reusable scripts, and Terragrunt orchestration.

### Architecture Layout
```
cloudinfra-360/
├── terragrunt/
│   ├── dev/ ─── aws, azure, gcp
│   ├── staging/ ─── aws, azure, gcp
│   └── prod/ ─── aws, azure, gcp
├── modules/
│   ├── networking/ ── vpc, subnet, peering per cloud
│   │   ├── aws/
│   │   ├── azure/
│   │   └── gcp/
│   ├── security/ ── IAM, NSG, KMS, DDoS
│   │   ├── aws/
│   │   ├── azure/
│   │   └── gcp/
├── env-configs/ ── *.tfvars per environment
├── Taskfile.yaml ── developer automation
└── README.md
```

### Security
- IAM + Least Privilege Roles (Terraform-managed)
- Subnet segmentation using AWS Security Groups, Azure NSGs, GCP Firewall Rules
- Encryption at Rest using AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP KMS
- DDoS Protection: AWS Shield, Azure DDoS Plans, GCP Cloud Armor

### Networking
- VPCs/VNets with public and private subnets
- Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways, and Route Tables
- VPN Gateways and Cross-cloud Peering
- Modular Terraform: main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, *.tfvars, terragrunt.hcl

### Observability
- AWS: VPC Flow Logs with CloudWatch
- Azure: Network Watcher + Log Analytics
- GCP: Operations Suite and Connectivity Tests

### Automation with Taskfile
The `Taskfile.yaml` enables repeatable commands across cloud environments:
```bash
task init ENV=dev CLOUD=aws      # terragrunt init
task apply ENV=prod CLOUD=gcp    # terragrunt apply
task fmt                          # Format all Terraform files
task lint                         # Lint modules
```

## Results (In Progress)
- AWS VPC, Subnet, NAT, VPN, and Flow Logs fully automated
- Terraform + Terragrunt modular architecture deployed across environments
- Network provisioning time reduced by 60%
- Cloud-native security and observability enforced at every layer

Future: Azure and GCP integrations will enable complete hybrid readiness and compliance for T2S's international expansion.
