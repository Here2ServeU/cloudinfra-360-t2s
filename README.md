# CloudInfra-360 Case Study: Transformed 2 Succeed (T2S)

**Client:** Transformed 2 Succeed (T2S)
**Project Status:** In Progress

## Case Study Summary
CloudInfra-360 was initiated as a strategic solution for **Transformed 2 Succeed (T2S)**, an organization expanding its digital training and mentorship programs across international regions. The company required a **scalable, secure, multi-cloud infrastructure** to support global users, ensure network performance, and maintain regulatory compliance across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

---

## SITUATION
T2S was experiencing rapid growth and needed to:
- Serve customers across **multiple regions** using **cloud-native and hybrid infrastructure**.
- Ensure **zero trust security**, **full-stack observability**, and **connectivity** between cloud environments and on-prem labs.
- Reduce deployment time and infrastructure misconfigurations via **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.

---

## TASK
Design and implement a **multi-cloud, production-ready infrastructure template** to:
- Provision consistent networking resources across AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- Secure all layers (VMs, subnets, VPCs, regions).
- Integrate VPN and VPC peering for hybrid/on-prem connectivity.
- Enable cloud-native observability using CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Operations.
- Leverage **modular Terraform + Terragrunt** for environment-specific deployments.

---

## ACTION
We developed **CloudInfra-360**, a unified IaC solution with:

### Security
- IAM + least privilege access
- Subnet-level segmentation and NSGs/Security Groups
- Encryption via KMS, Key Vault, and GCP KMS
- DDoS protection: AWS Shield, Azure DDoS, Cloud Armor

### Networking
- VPC/VNet with public + private subnets
- Internet Gateways, NAT, Route Tables
- VPN Gateways + Cloud-to-Cloud Peering
- Future: ExpressRoute + Direct Connect

### Observability
- CloudWatch Logs + Flow Logs for AWS
- Azure Network Watcher + Log Analytics
- GCP Operations Suite + Connectivity Tests

---

## RESULTS (WIP)
So far, the T2S infrastructure team has achieved:
- Standardized VPC module deployed to AWS across environments
- Reduced network deployment setup time by 60%
- Enhanced compliance posture with layered security defaults
- Clear visibility via cloud-native observability tools

> Future integrations with Azure and GCP will enable global scalability and full hybrid deployments to support T2S's international programs.
